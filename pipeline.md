# Week 1

Afzal showed me DJI drone video. I decided that I want to implement their localization from cameras! Matous agreed, I started research.<br>

Matous and Dan gave me the `basler` camera and 200deg lenses =)

# Week 2

After two-three days of calibration I decided to reduce the lens angle, and leave 180deg+ for the future =)

# Week 3
Lenses replaced. Victor helped me to calibrate cameras, started estimating the rotation and translation between cameras
